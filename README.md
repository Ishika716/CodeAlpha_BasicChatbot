## Project Description
This repository contains the source code for the Basic Chatbot project, developed as part of the CodeAlpha Python Programming Internship. This project demonstrates a simple rule-based chatbot that responds to predefined user inputs.

## Features
* Responds to "hello" with "Hi!"
* Responds to "how are you" with "I'm fine, thanks! ðŸ‘‹"
* Responds to "bye" with "Goodbye! ðŸ‘‹ Have a great day!"
* Provides a generic response for unrecognized inputs.

## How to Run
1.  Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2.  Clone this repository to your local machine:
    `git clone https://github.com/ishika716/CodeAlpha_BasicChatbot.git`
3.  Navigate to the project directory:
    `cd CodeAlpha_BasicChatbot`
4.  Run the chatbot:
    `python Basic_Chatbot.py`

## Key Concepts Used
* `if-elif-else` statements for conditional logic
* `while` loop for continuous interaction
* `input()` and `print()` for user interaction
* Basic string manipulation (e.g., `.lower()`)
